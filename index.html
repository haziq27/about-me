            My name is Muhammad Haziq bin Mohd Khanapiah but you can call me
            Haziq. I was born on 27th March 1991 in Kuala Lumpur.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like Maths so that's why I decided to take Bachelor's Degree in
            Mechanical Engineering at Tenaga National University, Malaysia right
            after I finished high school. After graduated for my degree, I
            realised it wasn't for me. I tried looking for alternatives and that
            is when I met a friend who introduced me to coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pursued my passion for tech by entering a coding bootcamp in Next
            Academy, Malaysia. There, they taught all required skills for me to
            get started in tech industry.

          <p>
            We had 2 weeks to complete our group project. The theme was
            education. After discussion with my team members, we decided to
            create an app called Quizzly. It is a tool for teachers to analyze
            student's progress in the classroom.
